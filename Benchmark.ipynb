    "Earlier today Meta released [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama3), the next iteration of the open-access Llama family. Llama 3 comes in two sizes: [8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) for efficient deployment and development on consumer-size GPU, and [70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-instruct) for large-scale AI native applications. Both come in base and instruction-tuned variants. In addition to the 4 models, a new version of Llama Guard was fine-tuned on Llama 3 8B and is released as Llama Guard 2 (safety fine-tune).\n",

      "3. **Automatic feature learning**: Deep learning models can automatically learn features and representations from the data, without the need for manual feature engineering.\n",
      "4. **Large amounts of data**: Deep learning models require large amounts of data to train, and they can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that data.\n",

      "Some of the key benefits of deep learning include:\n",

      "1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: These are commonly used for image recognition and computer vision tasks.\n",
      "2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: These are commonly used for natural language processing and speech recognition tasks.\n",
